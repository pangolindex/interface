Last updated: 23 September 2021

Vizier Pte Limited, a limited company registered in the British Virgin Islands ("us", "we", or "our") operates and manages the [https://pangolin.exchange/](https://pangolin.exchange/), [https://info.pangolin.exchange](https://app.pangolin.exchange/) and [https://app.pangolin.exchange](https://app.pangolin.exchange/) websites (the "Service"). This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use and disclosure of Personal Information when you use our Service.

We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy. We use your Personal Information for providing and improving the Service. By using the Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy. Unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy, terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms of Service.

**Information Collection And Use**

We have designed the Services to minimise the collection of Personal Information. Simply put, we want you to own and control your own data as far as is practicable.

However, while using our Service, situations may arise where you provide us with certain personally identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify you. Personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") may include, but is not limited to name and contact details (such as your address, email address and telephone number), nationality, business interests, employment history and positions held, trading history, wallet details and interactions with the Service and those provided by third parties, as well as information of all kind from correspondence, contacts and interactions with us.

Personal Information also includes information and data about clients, related persons, counterparties, authorities, courts, third parties and other persons as well as their respective representatives, agents and employees.

We will also process information of all kinds that is revealed to us in the course of our Services or collected by us. This information may include special categories of sensitive data. If the processing of special categories of sensitive data requires your consent, we obtain your consent before the fact.

**Use of Personal Information**

We may use this information to provide goods and services to you, to run our Service&#39;s business (e.g. carry out administrative or operational processes), monitor and analyse our business or to improve our services and products for you.

We and our related third parties may use your Personal Information for other legitimate business purposes including, without limitation, to maintain and develop our business relationship with you, identify services you may be interested in, to pursue certain business development initiatives, send you publications and marketing communications, invite you to events and to comply with our legal obligations to identify and verify the identity of our clients as well as to prevent fraud, investigate security and privacy breaches and maintain the security and good functioning of the Service. By accessing this site, you agree that we may use Personal Information for these and the other purposes identified in this Privacy Policy.

If necessary or useful for us to provide our services or for other purposes defined in this Privacy Policy, we may share your Personal Information collected in the course of providing legal services with third parties (such as advisors, related parties, courts, authorities, counterparties and other persons) in Switzerland, Australia, the US, the EU, Singapore, Hong Kong, the United Kingdom, Canada and other countries if required or useful for providing the Services ("Core Jurisdictions"). Further, we may share your Personal Information with third parties where:

1. you have consented to us doing so (where necessary) or the organisation that you work for has obtained your consent for us to do so (where necessary);
2. we are under a legal, regulatory or professional obligation to do so (for example, to comply with anti-money laundering or sanctions requirements); or
3. it is necessary in connection with legal proceedings or in order to exercise or defend legal rights.

We also use third parties who provide services on our behalf and may share your information with them, for example banks, insurance companies, technology and software suppliers who may have access to your Personal Information when providing software support.

 If third parties are located outside of the Core Jurisdictions, we only share your Personal Information on a basis that requires such third parties to protect your Personal Information.

We have designed the Services to minimise the collection of information that your browser sends whenever you visit our Service ("Log Data"). This Log Data may include information such as your computer&#39;s Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, browser version, the pages of our Service that you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on those pages and other statistics.

**How long do we keep Personal Information?**

We will retain your Personal Information for as long as is necessary for the purpose for which it was collected. We will further retain your Personal Information to comply with legal and regulatory obligations, for as long as claims could be brought against us and for as long as legitimate interests, including data security, require.

**Service Providers**

We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate our Service, to provide the Service on our behalf, to perform Service-related services or to assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.

These third parties may have access to your Personal Information to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.

The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use all reasonable endeavours to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

**Links To Other Sites**

Our Service may contain links to other sites that are not operated by us. If you click on a third party link, you will be directed to that third party&#39;s site. We strongly advise you to review the privacy policy of every site you visit.

**Children&#39;s Privacy**

Our Service does not address anyone under the age of 18 ("Children").

We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under 18.

3. Please note that we may refuse or limit to grant these rights for legal reasons or based on data protection legislation.
